# EyeQoE_Dataset

Contact person: Huadi Zhu (huadi.zhu@mavs.uta.edu)

This dataset is collected for EyeQoE in a campaign over a three-month span, covering 3500 traces from 50 volunteers each invited to watch 70 videos.
The video set includes 10 source videos of different quality versions, i.e., 720 p, 1080 p, 2K, 8 stalls, 4 stalls, 2 stalls, and original.
Each trace file corresponds to one video play with 5000 timestamps (25 s * 200 Hz) and contains raw data collected by the eye tracker.
Raw data include: timestamp, head rotation (pitch, yaw, and roll) , gaze position (x and y), pupil diameter, eye openness (1 = open vs 0 = closed), gaze vergence distance (GVD), and action (1 = fixation vs 0 = saccade).
The user-rated QoE label (1-5), together with video quality version and subjective factors, i.e., cybersickness, fatigue, and immersiveness, are also presented in each trace file.
